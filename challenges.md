#### Qestion: Detecting faulty energy consumption
The `train_data.csv` contains energy consumption data of some store for some given days in the past where the store was working at an acceptable level of energy consumption (every day in the train_data can be considered good data, i.e. the store was working at an acceptable level).

The date, energy and enthalpy variables are given. A relationship between enthalpy (average daily outside air enthalpy) and energy (the total store energy consumption) exists (enthalpy is the independent variable, and energy is the dependent variable).

Create a machine learning model that would determine days where the store is not working optimally. Use the model to determine which days in the `test_data.csv` were at an acceptable level of energy consumption, and which days were not (energy consumption is too high).

Explain the method chosen, and why it was chosen. If you made any assumptions, describe them also. You can supply graphs and other visual aids to help explain your solution. Provide all the code as well.

For convenience, `data.csv` contains all data (both the train and the test data) and can be used if needed.
